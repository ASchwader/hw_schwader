My homework is incomplete. I apologize and will take any partial credit I can get.

I created a make rule "listtest" for problem 3, but get a series of errors that I don't know how to handle when the rule runs. However, I believe my implementation works.

The make rule to compile my code for problem 5 is "p5".
